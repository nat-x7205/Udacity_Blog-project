          <div class="main-card__text">
            Say hello to the world’s largest sand island, Fraser Island! Known as K’gari (meaning paradise) by the traditional owners, the Butchulla people, this World Heritage-listed island’s diverse landscapes and unique wildlife entices thousands of tourists to its shores each year. Located just 360km north of Queensland’s capital city, Brisbane, and just a short 40-minute boat ride from the mainland here in Hervey Bay.

          <h3>Thredbo</h3>
          <div class="main-card__text">
            Home to Australia’s longest ski runs, Thredbo is a picturesque alpine valley that’s shrouded in powder during the winter months and covered with hiking trails to explore the rest of the year. The village and snow resort can be found in the heart of Kosciuszko National Park at between 1,365m and 1,930m above sea level, where the white stuff falls between June and October. Its cosy village is full of hillside chalets, homely restaurants and a more than a pub or two to keep busy in while not on the slopes.

          <div class="main-card__text">
            Sovereign Hill is a living museum presenting the story of Ballarat as a goldrush boomtown. Gold was discovered here in 1851, triggering the greatest alluvial gold rush the world has ever known. The sleepy pastoral settlement of Ballarat grew rapidly into a fine provincial city built on the wealth derived from its gold.
            Covering 15 hectares of a former gold mining site, Sovereign Hill's Outdoor Museum brings the gold rushes to life through a living township with diggings, underground mines, costumed characters, coach rides and 1850s shops, trades, schools and dwellings.

          <h3>Stargazing</h3>
          <div class="main-card__text">
            The Milky Way galaxy sparkles brightly in all its celestial wonder when you’re stargazing in the iconic Warrumbungle National Park, Australia’s first Dark Sky Park near Coonabarabran. Here, the stars are your destination - the pristine night sky above the volcanic landscape is unimpeded by artificial light.
  Inside the national park is the Siding Spring Observatory, where the largest optical telescopes in Australia are pointed at the cosmos. Astronomy research in the Warrumbungles dates back to the 1950s, and the International Dark Sky Association bestowed the park with dark sky status in 2016.
